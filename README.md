# JSBenchIt

See [jsbenchit.org](https://jsbenchit.org)

A JavaScript Perf Tester based on Github Gists.
It's your data!

Also see [jsgist.org](https://jsgist.org)

## Why? 

JSPerf disappeared, JSBench.me is hard to read. JSBen.ch
is buggy and can't save more than a small amount of text.
It seemed to me this might not be that hard (famous last words ðŸ˜…).

In any case this is open source so contributions welcome.

## TODO

[ ] support github login instead of using personal access tokens?

   I didn't do that originally because there is no way to login
   with github without a server in the middle. It might be simple
   to add a server if the only thing it does is do the oauth
   redirect. I'm just worried about maintanence and costs.
   
[ ] mobile formatting

   I have't really bothered with mobile formatting other than
   checking that it seems to run and not be too messed up.
