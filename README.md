# JSBenchIt

**(! still work-in-progress, not ready for use)**

A JavaScript Perf Tester based on Github Gists

## How To Use

To use this you need to create a github personal access token. No
worries, the token only needs permission to read and write
gists AND it is only stored in your browser (though you should
probably back it up since the browser might lose it).

This is a static webpage. It just reads gists (or json from
any url) and this displays a UI for JavaScript benchmarks.



## Why? 

JSPerf disappeared, JSBench.me is hard to read. JSBen.ch
is buggy and can't save more than a small amount of text.
