# JSBenchIt

See [jsbenchit.org](https://jsbenchit.org)

A JavaScript Perf Tester based on Github Gists.
It's your data!

Also see [jsgist.org](https://jsgist.org)

## Why? 

JSPerf disappeared, JSBench.me is hard to read. JSBen.ch
is buggy and can't save more than a small amount of text.
I seemed to me this might not be that hard (famous last words ðŸ˜…).

In any case this is open source so contributions welcome.
